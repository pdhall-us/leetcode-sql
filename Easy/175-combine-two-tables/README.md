# 175. Combine Two Tables

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the `Person` table.

If the address of a `personId` is not present in the `Address` table, report `null` instead.

Return the result table in any order.

## Table: `Person`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `personId`  | int     |
| `lastName`  | varchar |
| `firstName` | varchar |

`personId` is the primary key (a column with unique values) for this table.

This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.

## Table: `Address`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `addressId` | int     |
| `personId`  | int     |
| `city`      | varchar |
| `state`     | varchar |

`addressId` is the primary key (a column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID equal to `personId`.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Person table:**

| personId | lastName | firstName |
| -------: | -------- | --------- |
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |

**Address table:**

| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
| --------: | -------: | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |

**Output:**

| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Allen     | Wang     | null          | null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |

**Explanation:**

There is no address in the `Address` table for `personId = 1`, so `null` is returned for the city and state.

The row with `addressId = 1` contains the address information for `personId = 2`, so Bob's city and state are returned as `New York City` and `New York`.
