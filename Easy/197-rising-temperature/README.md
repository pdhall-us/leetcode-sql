# 197. Rising Temperature

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Write a solution to find all dates' `id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

## Table: `Weather`

| Column Name   | Type |
| ------------- | ---- |
| `id`          | int  |
| `recordDate`  | date |
| `temperature` | int  |

`id` is the column with unique values for this table.

There are no different rows with the same `recordDate`.

This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Weather table:**

| id | recordDate | temperature |
| -: | ---------- | ----------: |
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

**Output:**

| id |
| -: |
| 2  |
| 4  |

**Explanation:**

On `2015-01-02`, the temperature was higher than the previous day (`25 > 10`).

On `2015-01-04`, the temperature was higher than the previous day (`30 > 20`).

Therefore, the result contains IDs `2` and `4`.
