# 183. Customers Who Never Order

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

## Table: `Customers`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `id`        | int     |
| `name`      | varchar |

`id` is the primary key (a column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.

## Table: `Orders`

| Column Name  | Type |
| ------------ | ---- |
| `id`         | int  |
| `customerId` | int  |

`id` is the primary key (a column with unique values) for this table.

`customerId` is a foreign key referencing the `id` from the `Customers` table.

Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Customers table:**

| id | name  |
| -: | ----- |
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

**Orders table:**

| id | customerId |
| -: | ---------: |
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |

**Output:**

| Customers |
| --------- |
| Henry     |
| Max       |

**Explanation:**

Joe and Sam have placed orders.

Henry and Max do not have any corresponding orders in the `Orders` table, so they are returned in the result.
