# 596. Classes With at Least 5 Students

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

## Table: `Courses`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `student`   | varchar |
| `class`     | varchar |

`(student, class)` is the primary key (a combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Courses table:**

| student | class    |
| ------- | -------- |
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |

**Output:**

| class |
| ----- |
| Math  |

**Explanation:**

- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
