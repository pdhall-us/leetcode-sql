# 584. Find Customer Referee

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Find the names of the customer that are either:

1. **Referred by** any customer with `id != 2`.
2. **Not referred by** any customer.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## Table: `Customer`

| Column Name  | Type    |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `id`         | int     |
| `name`       | varchar |
| `referee_id` | int     |

In SQL, `id` is the primary key column for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Customer table:**

| id | name | referee_id |
| -: | ---- | ---------: |
|  1 | Will |       null |
|  2 | Jane |       null |
|  3 | Alex |          2 |
|  4 | Bill |       null |
|  5 | Zack |          1 |
|  6 | Mark |          2 |

**Output:**

| name |
| ---- |
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
