# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in.

In other words:

- Find the first login date for each player.
- Determine whether the player logged in again on the immediately following day.
- Divide the number of such players by the total number of players.

Round the result to 2 decimal places.

## Table: `Activity`

| Column Name    | Type |
| -------------- | ---- |
| `player_id`    | int  |
| `device_id`    | int  |
| `event_date`   | date |
| `games_played` | int  |

`(player_id, event_date)` is the primary key (a combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

This table shows the activity of players of some games.

Each row represents a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on a particular day using some device.

## Example 1

**Input:**

**Activity table:**

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
| --------: | --------: | ---------- | -----------: |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

**Output:**

| fraction |
| -------: |
| 0.33     |

**Explanation:**

- Player 1 first logged in on `2016-03-01` and logged in again on `2016-03-02`, which is the next day.
- Player 2 did not log in again on the day after their first login.
- Player 3 did not log in again on the day after their first login.

Only 1 out of 3 players logged in again on the day immediately following their first login.

Therefore, the fraction is `1 / 3 = 0.33`.
